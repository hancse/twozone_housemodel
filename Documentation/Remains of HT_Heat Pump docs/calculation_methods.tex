\section{Calculation methods}
	
Hot tap water profile for apartments building with 24 residential houses.
From equation (4):
	
\[V_{WW;60} = 243 + 67.9\sqrt{n} + 12.8n\]
	
Applied for n = 4 and n = 24
	
\[ratio =\frac{V_{WW;60;24}}{V_{WW;60;1}}\]
\[f_{new} =f.ratio\]
$f_{new}$: new water flow rate.\\
Look at figure 9 for an example.The amount of water use (litter)
	
\[m = \frac{3600.Q_{tap}}{c.\Delta T}\]
	
The time period that water has been used (hour)
\[water_{usetime} = \frac{m.24}{f_{new}.60}\]
	
Energy use per hour for 24 apartments:
	
\[Q_{tap/perhour} = 24.Q_{tap}.water_{usetime}\]
	
\[Q_{building} = Q_{hotwater} + Q_{heating}\]
	
with $Q_{tap/perhour} = Q_{hotwater}$
